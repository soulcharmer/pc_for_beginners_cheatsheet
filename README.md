AsciiDoc templates for beginner user stories to use personal computers

Phase 0 of the project

 * let's investigate what's out there and what we could reuse - some of our primary user stories are, roughly:
   * how to install fedora/linux
   * how to set up my AsciiDoc work environment
   * how to update/build/translate this guide - should be in AsciiDoc

Phase 1
 
  * create an AsciiDoc template for user stories. The actual user stories for students include:
    * how to run and use application X
    * how to access email
    * how to open Skype/videochat
    * how to work with documents
    * how to browse and manage photos on an external device
    * how to screen a movie from DVD
