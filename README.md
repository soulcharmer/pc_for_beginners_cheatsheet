AsciiDoc templates for beginner user stories to use personal computers

Some of the cheatsheets shall be for students directly, others should be for course intructors who would like to customize individual user stories but having no prior experience with AsciiDoc.

Phase 0 of the project

 * let's investigate what's out there and what we could reuse - some of our primary user stories are, roughly:
   * how to install fedora/linux - 2 main scenarios
     * clean installation
     * dual-boot installation on a machine with an existing OS
   * how to set up my AsciiDoc tool chain - 2 main sub-tasks
     * install and setup AsciiDoc-friendly text editor
     * install and setup an AsciiDoc processor, such as AsciiDoctor
     * compose and build a sample file
   * how to use Github
     * sign up, clone, edit, push, report
   * how to update/build/translate this guide - should be in AsciiDoc

Phase 1

  * create an AsciiDoc template for user stories. The actual user stories for students include:
    * how to run and use application X
    * how to access email
    * how to open Skype/videochat
    * how to work with documents
    * how to browse and manage photos on an external device
