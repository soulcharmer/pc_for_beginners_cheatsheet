AsciiDoc templates for beginner user stories to use personal computers

Phase 0 of the project

 * let's investigate what's out there and what we could reuse - some of our primary user stories are, roughly:
   * how to install fedora
   * how to update/build/translate this guide - should be in AsciiDoc
   * how to install application X

Phase 1
 
  * create an AsciiDoc template to populate with content. The actual user stories for students include:
    * how to run and use application X
    * how to access my email
    * how to open my Skype/videochat
    * how to work with documents
    * how to browse and manage my photos on external device
    * how to screen a movie form DVD
